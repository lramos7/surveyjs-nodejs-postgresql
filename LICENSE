This demo illustrates a basic integration setup between a sample React application that integrates the SurveyJS Survey Creator and Form Library components, and a Node.js + PostgreSQL backend.

Please note that the Survey Creator component is proprietary software and requires a developer licence to be integrated and used in your own application.

For full details, please refer to the SurveyJS Licensing FAQ at https://surveyjs.io/faq#licensing and the SurveyJS End-User Licence Agreement (EULA) https://surveyjs.io/Developer-License-Agreement.pdf.
